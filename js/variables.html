//variables can be declare as var,const,let  for example
var a = 3;
const b = 4;

//var
//variables defind with let have global scope
//we can redeclare 'a' again like and also we can use variable before declaration 
 a = 6;
console.log(a);  //now a is 6 
var a;
//let
// we can not redclare 'c' 
//let c = 3;
console.log(c); //it will show some error each variable defined with let must be declared before use
// variables defind with let have block scope

//const
//we can not rediclare 'b' 
//variables defiend with const can not be redeclared 
b = 5;
console.log(b);//if we reassign const  variable it will show some error
//const have block scope

//in javascript variales can be of any type like numbers, string, float atc
